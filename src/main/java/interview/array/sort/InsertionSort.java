/**
 * <b>Insertion Sort</b>
 * <p/>
 * Going back to our pile of books analogy, where we attempted to sort by weight, let's explore another approach
 * to sorting the pile of books. We'll start at the top of the pile and iterate over the books one by one. Every time
 * we encounter a book that is lighter than the book above it, we'll move the book up until it is in its
 * appropriate place. Repeating this for the entire pile of books, we will get the books in sorted order.
 * <p/>
 * This is the core intuition behind insertion sort. Given a collection of integers, you can sort the list by
 * proceeding from the start of the list, and every time you encounter an element that is out of order, you can continuously
 * swap places with previous elements until it is inserted in its correct relative location based on what youâ€™ve
 * processed thus far.
